# Paper_Presentations
Presentations while studying as an undergraduate intern in DILab, Korea univ.

VCR and ViLBERT Presentatations are made by me with Noah Lee(Korea univ, statistic).
Other Presentations are made by myself.

Thanks for all the authors of the papers.

## 1. UNITER
This presentation is for [UNITER: UNiversal Image-TExt Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11740).

UNITER is universal model for many V + L tasks.  

Source code for the UNITER is publicly available at [here](https://github.com/ChenRocks/UNITER).

```

```

## 2. VisualCOMET
This is for the [VisualCOMET: Reasoning about the Dynamic Context of a Still Image](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10796).

VisualCOMET is new task for visual commonsense reasoning that includes before, after scene and human intent on scene.

[Page](https://visualcomet.xyz/) and [source code](https://github.com/jamespark3922/visual-comet) for the VisualCOMET.

}
```
## 3. VCR
Presentation for [From Recognition to Cognition: Visual Commonsense Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.10830).

VCR presents a new task for visual commonsense reasoning that broaden the horizon, not only for congition but also recognition.
 
Datasets and leaderboard on this [page](https://visualcommonsense.com/).

Source code is [here](https://github.com/rowanz/r2c/) for VCR.

```

## 4. ViLBERT
Presentation for [ViLBERT: Pretraining Task-Agnostic Visiolinguistic Representations for Vision-and-Language Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.02265).

ViLBERT solve V + L task by applying BERT's model structure. And Athours present co-attentional layer for mixing vision and lauguage informations.

Source code are publicly available at [here](https://github.com/jiasenlu/vilbert_beta)
```

  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:1908.02265},
  year={2019}
}
```

## 5. COMET
This if for the [COMET: Commonsense Transformers for Automatic Knowledge Graph Construction](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05317).

COMET proves that AI can automatically construct novel and diverse knowledge graph by adopting transformer base model, starting with seed data. 

We can get the source code from [here](https://github.com/atcbosselut/comet-commonsense)
